# Contributing to MoveIt!

We want to encourage all MoveIt! users to contribute back to the open source project, whether enhancing documentation, answer user questions, reporting & fixing bugs, reviewing pull requests, or adding new features.

## Enhancing Documentation

Documentation for the MoveIt! project can be found in two places: within the source repositories and on the main website:

### Within the source repositories as Sphinx files

Tutorials and other concepts are documented as [reStructredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) files (similar to Markdown) in ``doc`` folders in various MoveIt! packages. For example, many of the beginner tutorials use the PR2 robot as an example, and their documentation pages can be found [here](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_pr2/tree/indigo-devel/pr2_moveit_tutorials/planning/src/doc)

To edit or add more tutorials, create Github pull requests to the appropriate location and the maintainers will graciously approve your help after review.

If you are interested in generating the html pages locally on your machine, install [rosdoc_lite](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdoc_lite) (``apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosdoc-lite``) and run in the root of the package:

    rosdoc_lite .

i.e. [pr2_moveit_tutorials](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_pr2/tree/indigo-devel/pr2_moveit_tutorials). This will automatically pick up the rosdoc.yaml and write the documentation to ``doc/html``

For deploying documentation changes to the web, note [Section 3 of rosdoc_lite wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdoc_lite):

>  rosdoc_lite is automatically run for packages in repositories that have rosinstall files listed in the rosdistro repository. The resulting documentation is uploaded to ros.org and is linked in the "Code API" links that you see on various package pages, like rospy.

This is done about once every 24 hours, [overnight](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdistro/Tutorials/Indexing%20Your%20ROS%20Repository%20for%20Documentation%20Generation).

### moveit.ros.org

Once you have created new Sphinx documentation, you'll need to create links to it from the main moveit.ros.org website so that other users can find it. Additionally, some higher level documentation can be found directly on this website, so you'll need to edit it there as well.

To edit or add pages on the MoveIt! website, go to [https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit.ros.org) and either edit inline using Github's web-based editing capability, or ``git clone`` the repo and push pull requests back to the repo.

## Answering User Questions

You can contribute greatly to the MoveIt! community by answer other people's questions on the [MoveIt! mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/moveit-users)

Additionally, the ROS community asks questions pertaining to MoveIt on [answers.ros.org](http://answers.ros.org/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:moveit/page:1/). Please feel free help answer questions there, and gain Karma in the process!

As an aside, a lot of documentation exists as Q&As on there, and if you feel so compelled, help us move some of that documentation onto the website.

## Reporting & Fixing Bugs

Bugs should be reported to the Github issues page of the appropriate repo. Please leave as much detail as possible including ROS and Ubuntu version. Note however that we have limited resources to fix individual bugs, and are more inclined to give advice on helping you fix your own bugs.

### Pull Requests

Our policy for contributing changes to the code base is that no one, not even the maintainers, should commit directly to the repo. Rather, you should create a feature branch on your own fork of the project then create a PR when it's ready to be reviewed by someone else. All changes should be merged by someone other than the author of the PR. The only exception to this rule is when cherry-picking commits from older branches (previous ROS releases) to newer branches.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Anyone can review open pull requests and comment on the changes. While only a handful of developers have push access to the repositories, your +1 in the comment threads helps us merge changes with more confidence and quickness.

To make it easier to review pull requests from others, we are currently working on [merging several repos togther](http://discourse.ros.org/t/migration-to-one-github-repo-for-moveit/266)

### Running Tests Locally

You can run MoveIt! tests locally with catkin-tools. To run a test for just 1 package:

    catkin run_tests --no-deps --this -iv

Run test for all packages:

    catkin run_tests -iv

### Using Docker to Review Pull Requests

Docker can help you easily evaluate someone else's changes without breaking your local setup, as well as test on other versions of Linux other than your local installed version. MoveIt! now has an [official MoveIt! Docker build](https://hub.docker.com/r/davetcoleman/moveit_docker/) that lets you quickly get a MoveIt! setup in a local container. Once docker is setup on your system, all you really need is:

    docker run -it moveit/moveit_docker:moveit-kinetic-source

Though there are many other images available for various ROS distros and purposes.

## Adding New Features

We would like to see MoveIt! continue to evolve and so new features are encouraged. However, it can be difficult to ensure that new features do not break existing functionality or user's code. For this reason, we ask you keep your pull requests in the smallest digestible chunks possible - not thousands of lines of changed code.

We recommend you open an issue first asking if the change is a good idea, before implementing it, so that you don't waste your time.

### Unit/Integration Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are **always** welcomed, please add them to your PRs. TODO: add more information here about how to create tests
